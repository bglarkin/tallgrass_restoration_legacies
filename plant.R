#' # Description
#' Plant data comprises two data sets. Mike Healy did quadrat surveys at 
#' all sites except Fermi, recording plant abundance. At Fermi, we only 
#' have relev√© data with presence/absence. These data were provided by Mike Miller. 
#' Wisconsin sites were surveyed in Aug-Sept 2016. Fermi sites were surveyed in summer 2017
#' 
#' Plant metadata includes taxonomy and life history traits, and should cover
#' both plant data sets. With the abundance-data sites, trait data are reported in percent cover. 
#' In the presence-data sites, traits are in counts of species with that trait per field. 
#' 
#' This script produces basic visualization and diagnostic views of the plant data. Two traits matrices
#' are output, one for sites with abundance data (16 sites), and one for sites with presence data only (20 sites).  
#' 
#' Plant data may be used in matrix form for ordination, etc. Abundance and presence/absence
#' matrices are available. The data may also be transposed and summarized as abundance
#' in taxonomic or life history classes. This makes sense for the abundance data, but
#' maybe makes less sense with the presence/absence data because the summary would
#' really be richness, not abundance. 
#' 
#' Plants data were obtained in the [TRY Plant Trait Database](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php) 
#' ([Kattge et al. 2010](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00067.x),

#' more useful to looking at development of plant communities over time after restoration. Traits may be filtered
#' more than species, and species' occurrence may not be uniform across sites, though a species' realized niche may 
#' include sites where it is not found. 
#' ### Sites with abundance data
#' An ordiation is run on plant abundance data using `pcoa_fun()`.

#' Axis 1 explains `r pcoa_ab$eigenvalues[1]`% of the variation and is the only eigenvalue that exceeds a 
#' broken stick model. The most substantial variation here will be on the first axis.
#' Axis 2 explains `r pcoa_ab$eigenvalues[2]`% of the variation and was not very close to the broken
#' stick value. Testing the design factor *field_type* (with *region* treated as a block 
#' using arguments to `how()` revealed a significant
#' clustering $(R^2=`r round(pcoa_ab$permanova$R2[1], 2)`,~p=`r pcoa_ab$permanova$Pr[1]`)$.
