#' # Description
#' Plant data comprises two separate data sets. Mike Healy did quadrat surveys at 
#' all sites except Fermi, recording plant abundance. At Fermi, we only 
#' have relev√© data with presence/absence. These data were provided by Mike Miller. 
#' Wisconsin sites were surveyed in Aug-Sept 2016. Fermi sites were surveyed in summer 2017
#' 
#' Plant metadata includes taxonomy and life history traits, and should cover
#' both plant data sets. With the abundance-data sites, trait data are reported in percent cover. 
#' In the presence-data sites, traits are in counts of species with that trait per field. 
#' 
#' This script produces basic visualization and diagnostic views of the plant data. Two traits matrices
#' are output, one for sites with abundance data (16 sites), and one for sites with presence data only (20 sites).  
#' 
#' Plant data may be used in matrix form for ordination, etc. Abundance and presence/absence
#' matrices are available. The data may also be transposed and summarized as abundance
#' in taxonomic or life history classes. This makes sense for the abundance data, but
#' maybe makes less sense with the presence/absence data because the summary would
#' really be richness, not abundance. 
#' 
#' Plants data were obtained in the [TRY Plant Trait Database](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php) 
#' ([Kattge et al. 2010](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00067.x), 
#' [Kattge et al. 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02451.x)) in 2016.

#' # Data
#' Plant community data includes:
#' 
#' - Metadata, taxonomy and traits
#' - Abundance data, surveyed in 2016, sites limited to Wisconsin only
#' - Presence data, from Fermi in 2015, all other sites converted to presence data, does not 
#' include Fermi switchgrass or corn fields.

#' Axis 1 & 2 explain 77% of the variation, and both eigenvalues exceed the broken stick model.

#' Many are very high. Traits levels need not be mutually exclusive, but it appears here that they are. 
#' Native opposes nonnative abundance, perennial opposes annual, and forb opposes C4 grass. The last case
#' may be driven by Karla Ott's field, but in other cases. What happens to VIF when one of these opposing factor levels 
#' are removed?
