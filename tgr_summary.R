#' # Description
#' The goal is to present results and discuss whether a path forward exists. If so, we will determine
#' the strategy that presents the best story, organization, and interpretation of these results. 
#' 
#' # Data
#' For this summary, I'll pull as many objects as possible from existing files to reduce the number of 
#' interspersed code chunks. A few quick new analyses will be necessary, though. Data are loaded here.

#' # Methods
#' ## Sites and design
#' The survey followed an unbalanced complete block design. Corn, restored, and remnant fields are compared, with 
#' at least one of each field type in each block. I have called blocks "regions" so far.
#' We collected samples and data from four regions, shown on the map below.

include_graphics("site_locations_files/figure-gfm/site_map-1.png")
#' 
#' The design is unbalanced because there are more restored fields than corn or remnant. In all but one case,
#' only single corn and remnant fields were available in each region. This means that we only have
#' replication to separate field types when using the entire block design.

      format = "pandoc",
      caption = "Count of fields by type and region:\nBM = Blue Mounds, FG = Faville Grove,\nFL = Fermilab, LP = Lake Petite")
#' 
#' The rules for establishing a chronosequence are strict. We cannot call fields from all regions a chronosequence. With 
#' seven restored fields in a small geographic area, the Blue Mounds fields are our best bet for this, but we will likely 
#' have to call this a "pseudochronosequence" and avoid some inferences. Mantel tests (not shown) failed to find correlations 
#' between soil variables and pairwise distance, giving us a little confidence that we're avoiding systemic bias.

#' 
#' ## Fungal communities
#' We collected soil cores from 10 haphazardly-selected locations in each field. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the 
#' lab and bioinformatics pipeline delivered community data from ITS or 18S regions clustered as OTUs or SVs. In preliminary work,
#' inferences made with SVs were weaker but not qualitatively different. I continued with OTUs only.  
#' 
#' A few samples had failed to amplify, leaving some fields represented with 9 samples instead of 10. 
#' This unbalance, which is normally not a problem, became unacceptable for a couple of reasons. First, I had planned to use permutation tests in 
#' ordinations, and application function `how()` from package `permute` requires balance at the plot (i.e., field) level. Second, 
#' I wanted to summarize the subsamples at the field level because fields are our replicates. Any comparisons with 
#' field metadata, where we have one data point per field, would be pseudoreplicated when regressed against subsample level data. 
#' 
#' Finally, after rarefaction it was clear that several samples contained very few sequences compared with the 
#' others. I used an iterative process to remove subsamples with few sequences, choosing a rarefication cutoff near the plateau of OTU 
#' recovery at depth (see figures). This ended up being 8 subsamples for ITS and 7 for 18S datasets. These subsample sequence 
#' values were then rarefied and used as-is, or, when reporting at the field level, subsample sequence values were summed
#' and rarefied. 
#' 
#' This process didn't remove many OTUs and doesn't change any major interpretation.

include_graphics("microbial_diagnostics_post_files/figure-gfm/its_rarefaction_curve_fig-1.png")
#' 
#' Even after this process, it's clear that fungal communities were undersampled.

#' 
#' ## Plant data
#' Plant community data resulted from two independent surveys. In the Wisconsin regions, haphazard transects were established
#' and 10 meter frames placed, with percent cover estimated for all species, resulting in a dataset with plant composition. 
#' In Fermi, relev√© methods were used, resulting in presence/absence data only. Plant metadata were assembled from multiple 
#' sources and include plant traits and natural history details. 
#' 
#' ## Soil data
#' In the field, soil was pooled from 10 haphazardly-selected locations, mixed, and sampled once for soil chemical analysis.
#' Soil data includes abiotic macro and micronutrients, organic carbon, and properties like pH. 
#' Average precipitation was determined for each field using PRISM climate data and is included with the soil data. 
#' 
#' ## Design/site data
#' 
#' - Field type: corn, restored, remnant
#' - Field age: years since restoration (NA for corn and remnant)
#' - Region: blocks
#' 
#' ## Response data
#' Also taken from the pooled soil in each field, one sample was taken for analysis of Water Stable Aggregates (I don't know who did these),
#' and one for quantification of microbial biomass.
